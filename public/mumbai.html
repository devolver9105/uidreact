                        <div class="container">
                            <div class="text">
                    <p>Nestled amidst the serene embrace of rolling hills, our college stands as a bastion of learning, where the academic journey intertwines with the beauty of nature. Perched atop the verdant slopes, it offers a unique blend of breathtaking landscapes and scholarly pursuits, creating an environment that inspires both the mind and the soul.
                      As one approaches the campus, the first thing that strikes is the panoramic view of the surrounding hills, draped in lush greenery. The college is like an oasis amidst this natural splendor, providing a tranquil retreat for students seeking knowledge and enlightenment. The cool mountain breeze whispers through the trees, carrying with it a sense of calm and tranquility that permeates every corner of the campus.</p>
                        <p>The campus architecture seamlessly blends with the natural contours of the land, with buildings designed to harmonize with the landscape rather than dominate it. Nestled amidst groves of trees and sprawling lawns, the academic buildings offer a peaceful sanctuary for learning. Each classroom boasts large windows that frame the majestic vistas outside, bringing the beauty of nature into the learning environment.
                        But it's not just the physical surroundings that make our college unique; it's the way in which nature is integrated into every aspect of campus life. Outdoor classrooms are scattered throughout the campus, providing students with the opportunity to learn amidst the beauty of the hills. Whether it's a lecture under the shade of a tree or a group discussion overlooking a valley, these outdoor spaces offer a refreshing change from traditional classroom settings.
                        Beyond academics, the hills offer a wealth of opportunities for exploration and adventure. Hiking trails wind their way through the surrounding forests, inviting students to venture out and discover the wonders of nature. For those seeking a more leisurely pursuit, quiet spots with benches and picnic tables provide the perfect setting for relaxation and reflection.</p>
                        
                        <div class="image">

                        </div>
                        <p>But perhaps the most profound impact of our college's hillside location is the sense of perspective it instills in students. Surrounded by the vast expanse of nature, students gain a greater appreciation for the world beyond the confines of the campus. They learn to respect the delicate balance of the ecosystem and to cherish the natural beauty that surrounds them.
                        Sustainability is a core value at our college, and efforts are made to minimize the environmental impact of campus activities. Solar panels dot the rooftops of buildings, providing clean energy to power classrooms and laboratories. Rainwater harvesting systems collect water for irrigation, reducing the campus's reliance on external water sources. And organic gardens yield fresh fruits and vegetables, providing nutritious meals for students and staff alike.
                        In the evenings, as the sun sets behind the distant peaks, the campus comes alive with the sound of laughter and conversation. Students gather on the lawns to socialize and unwind, their faces bathed in the warm glow of twilight. It's a magical time when the beauty of nature merges with the vibrancy of campus life, creating memories that will last a lifetime.
                        In conclusion, our college located amidst the hills offers a truly unique educational experience that combines academic excellence with the wonders of nature. It's a place where students can learn, explore, and grow, surrounded by the breathtaking beauty of the natural world.

                                    <dd>Members are responsible for the damage/loss of books issued to them. Marking and underlining the text, tearing away pages, soiling books by water, dust, oil etc., are treated as damage. Loss of library book must be brought to the attention of the librarian immediately on occurrence and the replacement cost of the material should be paid immediately. The member should compensate for the damaged/lost book by replacing it with a new copy. If notification is made after the book is overdue, the borrower will also be responsible for the overdue charge. If a book belonging to a set is lost, the borrower will be charged for replacement of the entire set. In case a student loses the book, he/she is be expected to replace the book along with a processing fee of Rs. 50/-. If he/she is unable to replace the lost book with a new one, he/she has to pay two times the cost of the book or the cost of acquiring a new one, whichever is higher.</dd>

For example, many youngsters are falling prey to various disorders such as high stress levels, high blood pressure, anxiety related disorders, insomnia – the list is endless. One of the main causes is that the youngsters of this generation are physically unfit to handle the pressure.

This mission is accomplished by us at the physical education department.</p>
